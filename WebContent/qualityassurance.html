                  <p>The Quality of drinking water in Chennai is maintained and monitored by Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board through the Quality Assurance Wing. The Quality of water is monitored through sampling, testing and reporting through the team of trained personnel in the laboratory and field. This division is headed by Executive Engineer and consists of Engineers and Analysts.</p>
                  <p>The Engineers of this wing provides the necessary Engineering service for effective functioning of the wing and does investigation, preventive actions, sanitary survey and providing necessary assistance to the field staff in water quality surveillance.</p>
                  <p>The Analysts does the work of collecting water samples, analysis and report to the Engineers concerned in regard to the quality of water supplied to the public confirming to water quality standards.</p>

                  <p>The scientific personnel in the Analytical section have a periodical sampling programme as per the W.H.O. norms, for monitoring water quality at the sources, treatment plants, Water distribution stations and in the distribution net work.</p>
                  <p>Water samples are being collected, once in a month from  the three lakes, which is major source of  water supply to the Chennai City daily . The treated water from the water treatment plants are collected from the test tap and samples were examined for conformity to physical, chemical and Bacteriological standards, besides monitoring the treatment process at various units.</p>
                  <p>About 150 samples are collected from the City distribution system every day for physical, chemical and Bacteriological analysis, Out of this, 60 samples are tested for for Bacteriological analysis to ensure the water is safe for drinking.</p>
                  <p>Apart from the sampling carried out by Quality Assurance wing, 200 depot. Engineers monitor the minimum level of Residual chlorine available in the water distribution net work.</p>
                  <p>The water supplied to the public is assured as per norms laid down in BIS: 10500-2012,the Indian Standard. The Physical, Chemical and Bacteriological quality of water should not exceed the limits shown in the table below:</p>

            <p> 3. Keep the vessel/ pot-containing drinking water away from insect breeding places.</p>
            <p> 4. Cover the vessel/pot containing drinking water from possible outside contamination through flies, mosquitoes etc.</p>
            <p> 5. Boil and drink.</p>
            <p> 6. Care should be taken to consume the stored water on the same day and do not store for more than two days.</p>
